### [1. Data Augmentation and Balancing of a Highly Imbalanced SPECT Scan Dataset][1]  
*Minor Project Submission by Harsh Yadav, Vinay Dagar (M.Sc. 2025)*
First steps towards a deep learning-based diagnostic approach for hyperthyroidism using SPECT scans.  
This project focuses on solving class imbalance in small-scale medical datasets through traditional, hybrid (STEM), GAN, and diffusion-based augmentation techniques.  
All these augmentation techniques are evaluated on Models like CNN, AlexNet, MobileNetV2, and ResNet50V2 using various performance metrics such as ROC-AUC curves, Precision, F1-score, etc.
