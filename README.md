### [1. Data Augmentation and Balancing of a Highly Imbalanced SPECT Scan Dataset][1]  
*Minor Project Submission by Harsh Yadav, Vinay Dagar (M.Sc. 2025)*

A deep learning-based diagnostic approach for hyperthyroidism using SPECT scans.  
This project tackles class imbalance in small-scale medical datasets using traditional methods, hybrid augmentation (**STEM**: SMOTE + ENN + MixUp), GANs, and diffusion-based techniques.  
All methods were evaluated across multiple models (CNN, AlexNet, MobileNetV2, ResNet50V2) using metrics like ROC-AUC, Precision, F1-score, and more.
